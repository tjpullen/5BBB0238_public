We are going to be using matplotlib to plot the number of bacteria over time, so remember to import it in all your programs. To plot the number of bacteria over time you will need two lists, one containing time points (here just an index that starts at zero and counts up in increments of one), and one containing the number of bacteria at that time point. Start off with a colony with 10 bacteria."
